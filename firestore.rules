/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BalanceView application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Users can only
 * access their own profile data and the bills associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the
 *   authenticated user matching the userId.
 * - /users/{userId}/bills/{billId}: Stores bill information. Access is restricted to
 *   the authenticated user matching the userId in the path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated users (not anonymous) can access data.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Read and write access is determined by path-based ownership, ensuring users can
 *   only manage their own data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data structure is designed to avoid `get()` calls by embedding the userId in the path
 *   for bill subcollections.
